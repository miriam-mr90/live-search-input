# Live Input Search

## Component previews
![alt tag](public/screenshot_examples.png)

## How does the filter work?
I use the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) which is an open movie database.
The input will search for a match in the movie name of the API Search results.

## Search examples:
- Wars
- Love
- Vampire
- Bat

## To do

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
